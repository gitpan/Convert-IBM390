Convert::IBM390 version 0.06

Version 0.05 was a transitional release.  Older releases included
separate functions for packed and zoned numeric conversion; this one
does not.  This is because packeb and unpackeb can handle all the
required conversions.

For instance, instead of coding
    $num = packed2num($packed);
    $zoned_out = num2zoned($num, 7,2);
you can now code:
    $num = unpackeb("p", $packed);
    $zoned_out = packeb("z7.2", $num);
Thus, there is really no need for separate numeric conversions.
