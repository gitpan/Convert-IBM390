Convert::IBM390 -- functions for manipulating mainframe data

Convert::IBM390 is a Perl module.  It supplies various functions that
you may find useful when messing with IBM System/3[679]0 data.  See the
POD documentation in the module, or "man Convert::IBM390" after you have
installed it.

How to Install
==============

The usual:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

At the end of "make test", you can expect to see the message "No tests
defined for Convert::IBM390::IBM390lib extension."  This is normal.
You may also see a few other error messages.  As far as I can tell,
these are harmless; they seem to result from my inexperience with
MakeMaker.  As long as the C code compiles correctly, the module
should work.

One More Note
=============

*** IF YOU CAN USE IBM390 RATHER THAN IBM390p, YOU SHOULD. ***

This module is written in a combination of Perl and C.  It should
compile cleanly in most environments.  If, however, you have trouble
compiling or installing this module, you can instead use IBM390p,
which is a Perl-only version of the same functions.  This version is
to be preferred, however; in my testing, the IBM390 versions of
pdi, pdo, and fcs_xlate ran 5-6 times as fast as the pure Perl 
versions.
