Convert::IBM390 -- functions for manipulating mainframe data


How to Install
==============

The usual:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If your C compiler defaults to signed rather than unsigned char (many
do), you may see some warnings about type mismatches, although I believe
I have corrected all such problems.  Anyhow, the mismatches are
harmless.  As long as the C code compiles correctly, the module should
work.

If you have to build the module a second (third, fourth, ...) time, run
"make clean" before running the above commands.


Debugging Option
================

This module should work on most platforms, but if you have trouble with
it (during "make test", for instance), you can compile it with a
debugging flag.  This will produce a number of messages in stderr at
run time.

Note the following lines in Makefile.PL:
       'DEFINE' => '',
  #    'DEFINE' => '-DDEBUG390',    # if debugging is desired

To enable debugging, just comment out the first line (add a '#' to the
front) and uncomment the second line (delete the first '#').  Then
rebuild the module, starting with "make clean".  E-mail me if you need
help interpreting the debugging output.

Be sure to rebuild *WITHOUT* debugging before installing the module for
general use.
